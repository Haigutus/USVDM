Dm can represent either the variation of the engine power with the shaft speed or the variation of maximum power capability with shaft speed.  If it is positive it describes the falling slope of the engine speed verses power characteristic as speed increases. A slightly falling characteristic is typical for reciprocating engines and some aero-derivative turbines.  If it is negative the engine power is assumed to be unaffected by the shaft speed, but the maximum permissible fuel flow is taken to fall with falling shaft speed. This is characteristic of single-shaft industrial turbines due to exhaust temperature limits.  Typical Value = 0.          \n",

This can be used as an alternative to the connectivity node path to topological node, thus making it unnecessary to model connectivity nodes in some cases.   Note that the if connectivity nodes are in the model, this association would probably not be used as an input specification.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
