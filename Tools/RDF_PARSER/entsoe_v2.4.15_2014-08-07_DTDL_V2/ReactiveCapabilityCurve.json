    "description": "Reactive power rating envelope versus the synchronous machine's active power, in both the generating and motoring modes. For each active power value there is a corresponding high and low reactive power limit  value. Typically there will be a separate curve for each coolant condition, such as hydrogen pressure.  The Y1 axis values represent reactive minimum and the Y2 axis values represent reactive maximum.",
