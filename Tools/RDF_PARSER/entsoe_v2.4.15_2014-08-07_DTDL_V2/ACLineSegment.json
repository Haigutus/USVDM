Additionally impedances can be computed by using length and associated per length impedances.\nThe BaseVoltage at the two ends of ACLineSegments in a Line shall have the same BaseVoltage.nominalVoltage. However, boundary lines  may have slightly different BaseVoltage.nominalVoltages and  variation is allowed. Larger voltage difference in general requires use of an equivalent branch.",
